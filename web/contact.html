                    Armin Rigo is a former researcher at the Heinrich-Heine Universitat
                    Düsseldorf (Germany). He studied Mathematics at the University
                    of Lausanne (Switzerland), obtained his Ph.D. in Logic and Set
                    Theory at the Free University of Brussels (Belgium) in 2002, and
                    worked at the University of Southampton (UK) until 2005. He is
                    the author of Psyco, the first just-in-time compiler for Python.
                    He is one of the founders and lead developers of the PyPy project
                    which began in 2003. He has taken part in all areas, from the Python
                    language definition to the RPython translation framework,
                    including the garbage collector and the tracing just-in-time
                    compiler.

                    the entire codebase including JIT, GC and assembler backends.
                    Maciej has been going to many conferences, advertising PyPy to a broader
                    audience for the past several years, including a keynote at Pycon 2010.

                    several papers about the inner workings of PyPy, presenting them at various
                    scientific conferences. Carl Friedrich is also interested in other dynamic
                    language implementation and was the original author of the Prolog
                    implementation.<br>

                    developer since 2006, working in various areas including the &ldquo;object oriented
                    backends&rdquo; for the CLI and JVM, the RPython translation framework, the Python
                    interpreter and the JIT compiler generator. Apart from PyPy, he is the author of

                    Both a PyPy and CPython core developer, Benjamin knows way too much about the
                    nooks and cranies of the Python language. He is driven by a fascination with
                    interpreters and compilers of all shapes and sizes. Around the PyPy project, he
                    tries to be generally useful and has taken on major projects including rewriting
                    PyPy's Python compiler and porting PyPy to Python 2.7.

                <p>
                    Håkan Ardö received his master of science degree in electrical
                    engineering from Lund University in 2002. He specialized in
                    VLSI-design and Image Processing. He worked as a software
                    engineer at Axis Communications 2002-2003 before doing his
                    PhD at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences of Lund University
                    2003-2009 in the Mathematical Imaging Group. His thesis work consisted
                    of designing image processing algorithms for traffic surveillance,
                    aiming for a system that automatically measures the safety of an
                    intersection or road segment. He is currently working part-time as a
                    postdoc at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences of Lund University
                    continuing this work and part-time as CTO with a spinoff company
                    Cognimatics. His contributions to PyPy started 2010 and consists of
                    the array module as well as work on the JIT compiler's trace optimizers.

                    PyPy core developement for several years as well as maintained much of
                    its infrastructure. He also is the author of the popular <a href="http://pytest.org">py.test</a> and

                    artificial intelligence applied to the game of Go. As of 2011 he is on
                    another sabbatical-ish leave, caring for his newborn son, travelling
                    and pondering what comes next. Other than that he continues to care
                    for testing and some PyPy co-ordination bits behind the scene.

                <p>
                    Samuele Pedroni got involved with PyPy almost at its inception in the
                    spring of 2003. One of the design contributors to PyPy, his help has
                    ranged from infrastructure and processes, through building out
                    RPython&#8230; optimizing the Python interpreter, to compressing resume
                    data in the last incarnation of the JIT compiler. Tempted away into the
                    application side of the software equation, these days he contributes
                    some words and wisdom to PyPy's paper writing.
